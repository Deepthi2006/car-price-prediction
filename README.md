# Car Price Prediction Model Deployment

This repository contains a machine learning model deployed using Flask to predict car prices based on user inputs. The web application accepts input (e.g., kilometers driven) from the user and provides a predicted car price.

---

## Features
- **Input Form**: User-friendly HTML form to input the number of kilometers a car has been driven.
- **Prediction**: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the car price.
- **Dynamic Web Pages**: Rendered using Flask templates (`index.html` and `result.html`).

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Add Your Model**
   - Include your pre-trained machine learning model as `model.pkl`.
   - Ensure it is compatible with the code in `app.py`.

4. **Run the Application**
   Start the Flask server by executing:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/index`.
2. Enter the number of kilometers driven in the input field.
3. Click **Submit** to get the predicted car price.
4. The result will be displayed on a new page.

## Files in the Repository

### 1. `app.py`
- The main Python file that sets up the Flask application.
- Loads the pre-trained model from `model.pkl`.
- Handles routes for:
  - `/index`: Displays the input form.
  - `/predict`: Processes the input and displays the prediction result.

### 2. `templates/index.html`
- Contains an HTML form where the user enters input (e.g., kilometers driven).

### 3. `templates/result.html`
- Displays the predicted car price.

### 4. `model.pkl`
- The machine learning model serialized using `pickle`.
- Ensure this file is trained and tested before using in deployment.

---

## Example Input and Output

- **Input**: Enter `15000` (kilometers driven).
- **Output**: Predicted car price will be displayed, e.g., "The predicted output is: $12,000".

---

## Notes
- The preprocessing step in `app.py` should match the model's training preprocessing.
- If the model requires multiple inputs or specific formats, adjust the `predict()` function accordingly.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add CSS to improve the UI/UX.
- Allow more input fields for additional car details (e.g., year, model, fuel type).
- Integrate APIs or databases for dynamic car data.
